# Appboard

Apps as widgets on your desktop 

## About

Appboard allows you to put apps on the Desktop or Notification Center via a widget. Just add a widget, right click, "Edit Appboard", and add paths to applications.

> **Note:** It _must_ be run from the Applications center

## Why?

I personally prefer to have desktop icons hidden (with `defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false`), but I'd still like to have easy access to some apps without adding more things to my already-overflowing dock.
